                <p>The wicketkeeper-batsman won the award for his decision to call back Ian Bell after the former England batsman was run out in a bizarre manner during a Test match in 2011. The Indian cricket team's official Instagram handle posted a image to congratulate Dhoni, who announced his retirement from international cricket on August 15, 2020, on bagging the spirit of the cricket award of the decade. While fans flooded the comments section with heartwarming messages for the former skipper, it was Rohit Sharma comment that stole the show. </p>

                <p>MS Dhoni received country's third highest civilian award, Padma Bhushan, from President Ram Nath Kovind on Monday. The former India captain, who holds the rank of Honorary Lieutenant Colonel, wore his official uniform of the Territorial Army for the ceremony. Apart from Dhoni, multiple billiards world champion Pankaj Advani also received the award for his extra ordinary achievements. Advani, 32, has ruled world billiards for several years. The Bangalore-based cueist has won 18 world titles. Ace cueist Pankaj had claimed the IBSF World Snooker Championship title in November last year.</p>

                <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni became only the second cricketer, a decade after Sachin Tendulkar, to receive the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award as he was conferred the country's highest sporting honour at a glittering function at the Rashtrapati Bhawan here on Friday.

                    The Indian ODI captain, however, could not attend the function as he was leading the team in the fifth and final match of the One-Day series against Sri Lanka, which India has already won.

                <p>India one-day captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has won the ODI Player of the Year award at the LG ICC Awards ceremony in Dubai.

                    Dhoni beat off tough competition from team-mate Sachin Tendulkar, Australia fast bowler Nathan Bracken and Pakistan stalwart Mohammad Yousuf to take the prestigious award.
                    
                    During the voting period, Dhoni played 39 ODIs and scored 1,298 runs at an average of 49.92 and at a rate of 82.46 runs per 100 balls faced. In that time he hit a century and nine fifties making sure he led his team from the front.
                    
                    Also in that time, wicketkeeper Dhoni captured 62 dismissals (46 catches and 16 stumpings), which is almost twice as many as the next best, albeit having played more matches than any other ’keeper.
